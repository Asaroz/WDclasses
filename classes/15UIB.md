# UIB - Elements

## Elements- Two types of elements
  - Block
    - Always start (on) a new line
    - Take up the full width available
      - stretch out to the left and to the right as much as they can
      - meaning it has a width of 100% by default
      - the height is defined by the content automatically OR by the developer
  - Inline
    - Start within an existing block-level element (they don't start a new line)### BLOCKS- main, nav, div, p, hr, lists(ul, ol, li), h1-h6, pre
- <section>
    - a section of the page which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to use
    - often these would have a heading
- <article>
    - a self-contained composition in a page, which is intended to be independently redistributable or reusable
- <aside>
    - a part of a document where the content is only indirectly related to the main content
- <header>
    - defines the top part of a page
    - often repeated in many pages
- <footer>
    - defines the bottom part of a page
    - often repeated in many pages- SO SO SO MANY MORE!### INLINE- span, a, em, br, img
